        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a soon-to-be graduate of the Univeristy of Oklahoma, I have had many valuable opportunities to connect with amazing people from various fields of business. It always interests me to learn about why others have chosen their field of work. For sometime I was unsure of what kind of work I wanted to pursue after graduation. One of the most valuable things I took away from my time at OU is to not be afraid to try new things. I am a double major in accounting and management information systems with the goal of earning a MBA.
