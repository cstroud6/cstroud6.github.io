        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a recent graduate of the Michael F. Price College of Business at the Univeristy of Oklahoma, it is my
		career goal to help business organizations leverage information technology to increase their business value.
		I started out as an accounting major, however with the increasing use of technology and data to serve business
		needs, I realized that understanding the relationship between business and technology was very important. MIS
		provided that link and I added it as a second major. I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning technical
		skills that I had not previously utilized. The opportunity to apply my new skill set at my current internship were
		almost instantaneous and to be able to see the value those skills added has been extrememly satisfying.
