        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a recent graduate of the Michael F. Price College of Business at the Univeristy of Oklahoma, my career goals have grown with momentum.
		I began OU as an accounting major, however, with the increasing use of technology to serve business needs I decided to add MIS as a second major. I took 
		my first programming class and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning a skill that I had no prior experience with. I have had the opportunity to apply my new skill set at my current
		internship. It is my mission to help business organizations leverage information technology to increase business value.
