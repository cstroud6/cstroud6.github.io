        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>As a soon-to-be graduate of the Michael F. Price College of Business at the Univeristy of Oklahoma, my
		career goal includes helping business organizations leverage information technology and data to increase their
		business value.	I am an accounting major who quickly identified the need for business professionals to know how to
		use technology and data to better serve the business. Understanding the link between business and technology 
		became very important to me to ensure I was prepared to meet those needs. The MIS major provided that opportunity
		and	I added it as a second major. I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of learning new skills that I had not 
		previously utilized. The opportunity to develop my new skill set at my current internship was almost instantaneous 
		and to be able to see the value those skills add has been exciting and fulfilling.
